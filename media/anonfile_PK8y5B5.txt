Governments and others have been poisoning Tor with their own nodes since the beginning, though
going throug Tor is great it doesn't offer you as much security as it used to. The best defense against
this is connecting to VPN or using other methods to obscure your connection before you connect to Tor. Also
remember traffic that's not https or encrypted over Tor is a susceptible issue with the poisoned Tor nodes.
Also recently there was a 0-day being used in the wild for Firefox which is what the Tor browser bundle uses.
This means that many individuals using Tor could have been compromised during this time (the most recent
update addresses this vulnerability).
