Ok so here is my deal. I have about 10 linux Red Hat workstations on my net work for people to use to do data processing. Right now the only way to tell if a computer is being used is log in (either SSH or VNC) and see whats going on. This means that you may have to go through all 10 computers to see whats running. Is there any way to just get a snap shot of all 10 computers and she if one is not doing anything? I know that most people are going to suggest that I cluster the systems together. This is a thought but I am not graduate student and not and IT guy and there for I don't want to have to spend my time setting it up and administering it. I have thought about it after I graduate but not now. Any ideas would be helpful. Thanks alot.
